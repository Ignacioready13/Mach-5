# Mach 5
A two-player racing game where the player must shift at the right time according to their engine RPMs.

The system is based on an Arduino Mega, using servos and light strips as output. It's controlled by a custom tactile stick shift controller.

You can find the Arduino code here to customize the game yourself, or download the models to 3d print your own game parts!
